# Visual-Symptom-Checker
The Visual-Symptom-Checker project is a small reinforcement learning agent implemented according to the paper "Improving Skin Condition Classication with a Visual Symptom Checker Trained using Reinforcement Learning", M. Akrout et al. 2019

## Overview. 
Doctors often ask their patients a series of questions to narrow down the set of plausible conditions that match the observed symptoms. By asking relevant questions, they can diagnose their patients more efficiently.
Visual-Symptom-Checker combines a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a Reinforcement Learning agent as a question-answering model.

## Dependencies 
1. Jupyter notebook
2. Pytorch
3. Numpy
4. Matplotlib
5. Sklearn
